const country = "usa"

//u can use underscores between numbers _ so 3_000_000 
//const population is a better answer bc only if u want to change the pop 
//leave it at const

console.log(country, continent, population)
//also console.log("firstName") console.log({firstname})

//function name is addition
function addition(num1,num2) {

//in console log if u add "" before the answer it gives you not just the 
//answer but also a description
